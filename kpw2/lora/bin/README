This is a VNC viewer for e-book devices
Copyright (c) 2013 Hans-Werner Hilse <hilse@web.de>

It works on the framebuffer, using the einkfb API from e-ink devices (einkfb.h) to do screen refreshs.
This is based on LibVNCclient (part of the LibVNCserver project, see http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/.


There's a discussion thread at

Note that the current version is a major rewrite from the original version.
The current version is implemented in Lua, targeted at LuaJIT.


Configuration:
--------------

input handling is configurable/customizable in "config.lua".

kVNCviewer supports a lot of options that determine various settings. Run it without any argument to show a list of supported options. In addition, libvncviewer parses the options, too. That allows for additional configuration settings. Look into the documentation of libvncviewer to see those options:
http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/doc/html/group__libvncclient__api.html#gabb2299d1644f3cf38544eb97d2356475


Building:
---------

In order to build kindlevncviewer, you can use GNU make. Specify a toolchain prefix as "ARCH" variable:

    make ARCH=arm-linux-gnueabihf

and it should build luajit, zlib, libjpeg and finally libvncclient.

You can find the result in the "dist/<ARCH>" subdirectory. Also, a .zip file is created for distribution.


Running:
--------

You need to copy the program and the libraries it needs (you can just try running it without and it will show you which libraries are missing) onto your ebook device. Then call (from a launcher app or a shell)

    ./luajit vncviewer.lua 192.168.2.1:1

(you will need to put in the correct server address or name and screen number).
